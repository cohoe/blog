My last static blog project started on January 1st 2013 while I was still in college. The last update was September 27th 2014. And while Octopress was great in concept it was difficult for me to be happy with the result and keep it going with simple posts. So here we are: Seven years and one-and-a-half pandemics later. Maybe this time it'll be different?

The goal of this newer cleaner site is to be both a decent landing page and a platform where I can share random tidbits and other small nuggets of knowledge with the world. It will be minimalistic, somewhat documented, and probably unstructured. If you stumbled in here I hope you find what you seek.
